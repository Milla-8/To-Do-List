# To-Do-List
 To-Do List (Individual Project v50)

This is a console app where user can manage different tasks in a To-do List.
User can add tasks containing Title, Description, Project, Due date and Status.
User can also add new tasks, edit and remove existing tasks, and show a complete task list sorted on Project or Due date.
The program loads all existing tasks from file and saves new tasks to same file when user chooses to exit.
A summary is shown when starting the app, making it easy for user to see hos many tasks they have completed and how many they still need to do.
For easier overview in the Task list, all tasks are separated with lines and the tasks that are done have green text.

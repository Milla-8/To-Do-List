# To-Do-List
 To-Do List (Individual Project v50)

This is a console app where you can handle tasks in a To-do List.
It loads all existing tasks from file and saves new tasks to same file when exiting the program.
A summary is shown when starting the app, making it easy for user to see hos many tasks they have completed and how many they still need to do.
User can add, edit and remove tasks, and show a Task list sorted on Project or Due date.
For easier overview in the Task list, all tasks are separated with lines and the tasks that are done have green text.
